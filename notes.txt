BIG TOPICS:
- Rendering Engine!!


- Some way to insert game into engine.
- Better scratchpad support
- Better textures (reading, blitting, basic image processing)
- Some way to separate game and engine data 
- Add higher level rendering constructs (Shaders, Materials, Meshes, Transforms...)
- Add some form of automatic shader selection
- Add some form of primitives (Rectangles, Spheres...)
- More flexible transform class.
- Non-perspective views, (orthogonal views)
