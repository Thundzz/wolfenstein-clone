BIG TOPICS:
- Rendering Engine!!


- Some way to insert game into engine.
- Better scratchpad support
- Better textures (reading, blitting, basic image processing)
- Some way to separate game and engine data 
- Add higher level rendering constructs (Shaders, Materials, Meshes, Transforms...)
- Add some form of automatic shader selection
- Add some form of primitives (Rectangles, Spheres...)
- More flexible transform class. (default values for projection and camera)
- Non-perspective views, (orthogonal views)
- Texture manipulation (Translation, rotation, scale)
- More control over textures (Filtering, Formatting)
- More friendly constructors (camera)
- Window should have more properties (Center position, fullscreen, maybe mouse locking)
- Better vector math (normalization, +=, Commonly used Vector constants)
- Options class/system, some place to read values that the player choses
- Centralized "level" or "scene" class that holds the data the game is using
-
